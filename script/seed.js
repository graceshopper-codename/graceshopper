From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established. You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to hostâ€”you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?',
